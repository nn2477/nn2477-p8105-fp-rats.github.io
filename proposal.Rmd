### Title: Ratistical Analysis: Do the rats run this city or do we?

#### Data Source 
* City of New York Rat Sighting Data 
* IPUMS USA 2022 
* City of New York Neighborhood Financial Health Digital Mapping and Data Tool 

### Motivation 

* In October 2022, New York’s recently installed Commissioner of the Department of Sanitation, Jessica Tisch, boldly proclaimed “The rats don’t run this city, we do.” To New Yorkers, this statement was more wishful thinking than it was grounded in reality. Rats are as much of a fabric of the city as dollar slices and delayed trains. Putting the lovable pizza rat aside, the presence of rats presents a challenge to public health. They are known to carry diseases that can be spread directly and indirectly through humans, erode critical infrastructure, and generally impact quality of life.  For this project, we set out to determine the veracity of whether humans or rats really control New York. Additionally, we examined whether rats disproportionately impact the lives of marginalized groups: low-income individuals, racial and ethnic populations, and individuals with disabilities. Although every New Yorker has the occasional run-in with rats, we sought to understand whether certain groups face increased exposure. We hope that this project contributes to the overall question: who runs this city?

### Intended Final Products
* A written report summarizing results of investigations
* A webpage containing motivation, introduction, questions and analyses, visualizations with interpretations and explanations (tables, graphs, interactive map, etc.), discussion, conclusions and next steps, limitations, and references
* A video introducing our webpage in details
* 

### Analyses, Visualization,& Challenges 
##### Planned Analyses
* General rat sighting analysis
* Change in number of rat sightings by year 
* Change in average number of rat sightings per month
* Analysis of rats by neighborhood in Manhattan via longitude and latitude data & density plot of rat populations in Manhattan 
* Analysis of neighborhood rat sightings compared to income/SES/wealth 
  * Compare SES dataset with rat sighting dataset to assess wealth to rat sighting 
  * Can run statistical analysis, possibly a regression model for this to access the relationship between SES and rat sightings
  * Map comparing neighborhood income in Manhattan to rat sightings utilizing latitude and longitude data 
* Population versus rat sightings 
  * Population density compared to rat sighting density by neighborhood 

##### Visualizations
* Mapping latitude/longitude coordinates in a leaflet map to show rat sighting distributions across Manhattan neighborhoods or in combination with outside factors 
* Box plots to compare monthly and annual averages in analyses for rat sightings compared to borough, population, SES, etc. 
* Bar plots to compare avg annual rat sightings by neighborhood in Manhattan 
* Density plots to show rat sighting and population density in Manhattan 

##### Coding Challenges 
* Data tidying 
* Ensuring all neighborhoods and zip codes are coded correctly 
* Plot reproducibility and readability 
* Keeping datasets tidy through the whole process and careful merging
  * Determining what variables to merge by 
* May need to exclude the year 2023 from analysis depending on what is being analyzed as the data for the year is not yet complete, which may skew results
