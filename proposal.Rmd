### Team Members 
* Victoria Mello (vsm2118)

* Eunsuh Cho (ec3663)

* Maggie Watson (mgw2144)

* Victoria Schliep (vas2145)

* Nhu Nguyen (nn2477)

### Motivation 
* Rats have been a significant problem for NYC residents
* Rats can cause damage to buildings and pose health problems
* We want to analyze potential trends between rat density and NYC-population data regarding income

### Data Source 
* City of New York Rat Sighting Data 
* IPUMS USA 2022 
* City of New York Neighborhood Financial Health Digital Mapping and Data Tool 

### Intended Final Products
* A written report summarizing results of investigations
* A webpage containing motivation, introduction, questions and analyses, visualizations with interpretations and explanations (tables, graphs, interactive map, etc.), discussion, conclusions and next steps, limitations, and references
* A video introducing our webpage in details
* 

### Analyses, Visualization,& Challenges 
#### Planned Analyses
* General rat sighting analysis
* Change in number of rat sightings by year 
* Change in average number of rat sightings per month
* Analysis of rats by neighborhood in Manhattan via longitude and latitude data & density plot of rat populations in Manhattan 
* Analysis of neighborhood rat sightings compared to income/SES/wealth 
  * Compare SES dataset with rat sighting dataset to assess wealth to rat sighting 
  * Can run statistical analysis, possibly a regression model for this to access the relationship between SES and rat sightings
  * Map comparing neighborhood income in Manhattan to rat sightings utilizing latitude and longitude data 
* Population versus rat sightings 
  * Population density compared to rat sighting density by neighborhood 

#### Visualizations
* Mapping latitude/longitude coordinates in a leaflet map to show rat sighting distributions across Manhattan neighborhoods or in combination with outside factors 
* Box plots to compare monthly and annual averages in analyses for rat sightings compared to borough, population, SES, etc. 
* Bar plots to compare avg annual rat sightings by neighborhood in Manhattan 
* Density plots to show rat sighting and population density in Manhattan 

#### Coding Challenges 
* Data tidying 
* Ensuring all neighborhoods and zip codes are coded correctly 
* Plot reproducibility and readability 
* Keeping datasets tidy through the whole process and careful merging
  * Determining what variables to merge by 
* May need to exclude the year 2023 from analysis depending on what is being analyzed as the data for the year is not yet complete, which may skew results
