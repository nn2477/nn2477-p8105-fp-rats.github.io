As shown in the line plot depicting monthly trends in NYC rat sightings across the years 2015-2020, there appears to be a general trend across the years where rat sightings increase as the weather in NYC gets warming during the summer months. The peak months for all years spans from May to August, with rat sightings declining sharply following October and the onset of colder weather. This observed trend is in line with expectations given that rats are known to be more active during summer months as they are gathering food to store for winter.

The table above was created by selecting all residential rat sightings and creating a new data set to then calculate the proportion of total rat sightings occuring in residential locations across all five boroughs. The table shows the Bronx as the borough with the highest proportion of residential rat sightings with about 81.9% of all reported rat sightings being in a residence. Brooklyn has the second highest proportion of residential rat sightings at 70.1%, followed by Staten Island and then Queens both at about 69%. Manhattan is the borough with the fewest residential rat sightings with only 65% of total reported rat sightings coming from a residence.
