### Motivation

In October 2022, New York’s recently installed Commissioner of the Department of Sanitation, Jessica Tisch, boldly proclaimed “The rats don’t run this city, we do.” To New Yorkers, this statement was more wishful thinking than it was grounded in reality. Rats are as much of a fabric of the city as dollar slices and delayed trains. Putting the lovable pizza rat aside, the presence of rats presents a challenge to public health. They are known to carry diseases that can be spread directly and indirectly through humans, erode critical infrastructure, and generally impact quality of life. 
For this project, we set out to determine the veracity of whether humans or rats really control New York. Additionally, we examined whether rats disproportionately impact the lives of marginalized groups: low-income individuals, racial and ethnic populations, and individuals with disabilities. Although every New Yorker has the occasional run-in with rats, we sought to understand whether certain groups face increased exposure. We hope that this project contributes to the overall question: who runs this city?


### Related Work
There was a high amount of discourse on the subject of rats in New York City that inspired this project, specifically published data from Fordham University, where researchers found that there was a small but discernible genetic difference between rats living uptown versus downtown in Manhattan. Additionally, a new feature in the ‘Transit’ app, called Rat Detector, is taking a more citizen science approach to see where the most popular rat hubs are. It uses sightings reported by users to keep tabs on which stations have the most rats and even ranks the stations based on how many rat sightings it has. However, despite the amount of discourse on the subject, data analysis between rat sighting and income was very limited. Thus, our project focuses on bridging that information gap. 


### Initial Questions

Our initial research question focused exclusively on the relationship between income and the prevalence of rat sightings. However, once we looked into the data available to answer the questions, we recognized that we could include additional parameters beyond income, including race, immigration status, and disability status. Adding these parameters would provide more granularity to our understanding on how the prevalence of rats differ by various socioeconomic classes.

Additionally, we first hoped to answer a question related to Mayor Eric Adams, who has his own repeated issues with rats around his Brooklyn row house. Mayor Adams entertained the prospect of using feral cat colonies to get New York’s rat population under control, and even went so far as to have Curtis Sliwa, a Guardian Angel with feral cats at the ready, show up to his rowhouse in January of this year. We hoped that we would be able to compare the presence of feral cat colonies to the number of rat sightings within a particular neighborhood, and gain a better understanding of whether Mayor Adams’ and Curtis Sliwa’s approach may have merit. Unfortunately, the data on feral cat colonies required to conduct this analysis was not readily available.


### Data Tidying

Income Data

Income data was important for us to have access to so that we could determine potential linkages between income and rat prevalence. Our income data (income_data_2020) includes median income by NYC neighborhood as well as the racial makeup of that neighborhood.  We imported the dataset, cleaned the names, and selected relevant variables:

`puma`
`borough` 
`neighborhoods`
`nyc_poverty_rate`
`median_income`
`perc_white`
`perc_black`
`perc_asian`
`perc_other`
`perc_hispanic`

We checked for missing values and any typos in neighborhood names, and then exported the clean dataset.

Rat Sighting Data

The City of New York Rat Sighting Data was a key dataset for us, and can be accessed at the link above. This dataset includes reports of rat sightings in New York City from 2010 to the present. At the time we accessed it, it had last been updated on November 25, 2023.

This entire dataset was downloaded to CSV. While we initially tried to read it in and commit it to GitHub in its entirely, the dataset proved to be too large. As such, it required that we filter and reduce that dataset to variables that were only of interest to our research questions. We then imported the dataset into R and further reduced the file to the following key variables:

`unique_key`
`created_date`
`closed_date`
`location_type`
`incident_zip`
`borough` 
`latitude`
`longitude`

We ensured consistency in data inputs of borough names, and separated the date variable ‘created_date’ into ‘month_created’ and ‘year_created’, ‘day_created’ and ‘time_created’. We followed the same pattern for the variable ‘closed_date’. 
This left us with the following variables:

`unique_key`
`month_created`
`year_created`
`month_closed`
`year_closed`
`location_type`
`incident_zip`
`borough`
`latitude`
`longitude`

We then filtered the data to only the years between 2015 and 2019. We checked for missing values, which were only identified in the longitude and latitude variables, and we decided not to remove these values. `year_created` and `month_created` were changed into factor variables rather than numeric for use in specific analyses, and `unique_key` was used to create count data estimates for exploratory analyses in smaller analysis data manipulations. We then exported the clean dataset.

### Discussion

Our analysis sought to analyze the relationship between the prevalence of rats in New York City and key explanatory variables, including income and race, and also to explore prevalence in different geographic areas of NYC. Although we had initially hoped to run a series of regression models comparing rat prevalence to different predictors (like income), we ultimately decided against this approach. This was largely due to the way the data is operationalized. The outcome data that we had available from our Rat Sightings Dataset was not continuous and was technically classified as counts, which would require we run a Poisson regression instead of a linear regression. We could not reformat our rat sighting observations into counts for a Poisson regression model, so we decided that descriptive statistics regarding rat sightings, median income, and population would be the most appropriate way for us to work with the data available.

Despite these limitations, our data revealed several interesting learnings. First, contrary to our initial hypothesis, the count of rat sightings did not increase during the year 2020, the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We initially believed that less sanitary servicing and fewer people on the streets would give rats more comfortability in roaming freely and this increase the number of sightings. However, rat sightings actually peaked in 2017. While this may be a function of fewer rats in the city, it may also be a function of people not being out in the streets as much to see and report rats, due to stay-at-home orders. Additionally, Brooklyn has the highest proportion of rat sightings per dollar of median income. Our initial thinking centered on Manhattan having the greatest proportion of rat sightings per dollar of income, due to having the largest population and thus more challenges with sanitation.

Our analysis would be strengthened by improvement in data availability. The greatest limitation was in the Rat Sighting Dataset, which as previously described was not an overall depiction of the rat population, but rather the count of rat sightings. Further analysis would include regression models that analyzed income and rat population covariance, and linkages between racial makeup of neighborhoods and rat prevalence.
