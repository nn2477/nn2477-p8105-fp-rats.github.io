This plot represents the average number of rats per person in 2020 by population for each borough of New York City. These proportions were calculated by divding the number of rat sightings in 2020 for each borough by the total borough population in the same year. In this plot we can see that the proportion of rats per person was highest in Manhattan and lowest in Queens.
